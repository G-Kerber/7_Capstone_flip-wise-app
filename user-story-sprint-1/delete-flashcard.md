# Delete Flashcard

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** delete flashcards that are no longer relevant,

**so that** I can maintain a clean and organised flashcard list, ensuring itâ€™s always up to date.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each flashcard in the flashcard list and the archive includes an easily accessible delete option.
- Clicking the delete option triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the deletion process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Upon confirming the deletion, the flashcard is removed from the respective list, and a success message is displayed.
- If all flashcards are deleted, a message appears indicating that there are no flashcards and providing an option to add new ones.
