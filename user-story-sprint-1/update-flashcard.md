# Update Flashcard

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** update the details of existing flashcards,

**so that** I can tailor the questions to better suit my learning needs and preferences.

## Description

Capstone Group Todo: Add wireframes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each flashcard in the flashcard list and archive includes an easily accessible edit option.
- Clicking the edit option opens a new page with a form pre-filled with the flashcardâ€™s existing details for modification.
- The form allows for edits to all flashcard details, including:
  - Flashcard question
  - Flashcard answer
  - Flashcard collection
- All fields are mandatory.
- The form section includes options for both saving and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the edit process if selected by mistake or if they change their mind.
- Submissions with empty required fields are blocked, with validation messages indicating the missing required fields.
- Upon confirming the save, the user is immediately redirected to the flashcard list or archive, and the changes are saved and reflected.
